# CS50-Web-Programming-With-Python-and-JavaScript
All the projects I've worked on for Harvard's online web development course "CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript"; each entries are separate projects from the course. They involve both the frontend and backend, but heavy emphasis on backend (Django). "Mail" was a bit different from the rest in that all the Python code was written for me and my task was to make the web application functioning by adding JavaScript.
